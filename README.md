Program uses parallel arrays to keep track of test average test scores for different high school grades

How it Works:

A ficitious high school has four grade levels from freshman - senior. At the end of the school year all of the students take a test where they can recieve a grade from 0 - 100. The school prinicipal wants to see a summary of the test scores for the tests that will display the grade level, number of students in the grade, and the average for the grade.

The program uses a method to accept test scores from the user, a parallel array to keep track of the number of students in each grade level and accumulate the test scores, and a second method to display the information for the principal.
